- Amelda (10.102.0.152)

## Description:
This Lab 6 submission includes a fallback implementation of the two required tasks using Python's multiprocessing module instead of mpi4py, due to persistent environment issues.

## Files Included:
- calculate_squares_mp.py: Parallel square number calculator.
- virus_simulation_mp.py: Parallel virus spread simulation.
- requirements.txt: Minimal required dependency (numpy).

## How to Run:
