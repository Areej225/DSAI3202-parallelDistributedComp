# DSAI 3202 – Assignment 1 (Part 2) – Parallel Genetic Algorithm with MPI

## Objective
Develop and evaluate a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in a **distributed manner using MPI (mpi4py)** to solve a city routing optimization problem.

The goal is to minimize the **total distance traveled by a vehicle**, starting and ending at **node 0 (depot)**, while **visiting all other delivery nodes exactly once**.

## Discussion: Genetic Algorithm Implementation

###  Key Components
- **Fitness Function:** Calculates negative total distance to minimize it. Penalizes unreachable paths with -1e6.
- **Selection:** Tournament Selection (see detailed explanation below).
- **Crossover:** Order Crossover (OX) maintains relative order of genes.
- **Mutation:** Swap mutation to introduce diversity.
- **Regeneration:** Population regenerated after stagnation.
- **Elitism:** Best individual is preserved every generation.
- **Population Uniqueness:** Duplicates are prevented after each generation.
- **Parallelization:** MPI used to distribute population evaluation and crossover steps.

## Assignment Questions – Detailed Answers

###  5.d Explain and Run the Algorithm (5 pts)

The file `genetic_algorithm_trial.py` implements a **sequential (single-threaded) genetic algorithm (GA)** approach for route optimization. The steps followed in the algorithm are:

1. **Generate Initial Population**: A unique population of candidate routes is generated, with all routes starting from node 0.
2. **Evaluate Fitness**: The total distance for each route is calculated using the `calculate_fitness()` function.
3. **Selection**: Tournament selection is used to choose the best-performing routes for reproduction.
4. **Crossover and Mutation**: Order crossover (OX) is used to combine parents and create offspring, followed by random mutation.
5. **Regeneration**: If the best fitness does not improve after a defined number of generations, the population is regenerated.
6. **Output**: The best route and execution time are printed at the end of the process.

Execution logs and outputs are shown in the final snapshot.

###  6. Parallelize the Code (20 pts)

####  Define Distributed and Parallelized Parts (5 pts)

The code is optimized for distributed execution using `mpi4py`. Key components parallelized are:
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Each process evaluates fitness values of its assigned subset of routes.
- **Offspring Generation**: Crossover and mutation are performed independently on each process’s selected individuals.
- **Population Management**: Centralized in Rank 0. Best route and regeneration decisions are made here.

####  Parallelize the Program (10 pts)

- MPI functions used:
  - `scatter()` to distribute population.
  - `gather()` to collect fitness scores and offspring.
  - `bcast()` to broadcast shared data like distance matrix and best fitness.
- Rank 0 handles global population update and elitism.
- Local populations are evolved independently in parallel.

####  Compute Performance Metrics (5 pts)

- **Execution Time** was reduced by ~20% in parallel execution.
- **Fitness Convergence** was smoother due to larger effective population and diversity from distributed mutation.
- **Speedup** was observed without loss in quality of solutions.

###  7. Enhance the Algorithm (20 pts)

####  Distribute on 2+ Machines (10 pts)

- The MPI-based design naturally supports scaling to multiple nodes.
- Simply running the same code on multiple machines using `mpirun` allows seamless distribution.

####  Proposed Improvements (5 pts)

- **Elitism**: The best individual from each generation is retained, ensuring continuous improvement.
- **Regeneration**: Detects stagnation and regenerates the population while preserving the elite individual.
- **Population Uniqueness Check**: Duplicates are removed to maintain diversity and solution space exploration.

#### ➤ Performance Comparison (5 pts)

| Metric | Sequential | Parallel |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Best Fitness | -2111.0 | -1969.0 |
| Execution Time | 14.3s | 11.9s |

- **Result**: Parallel version is more efficient, consistent, and scalable.

###  8. Large Scale Problem (10 pts)

####  Run on `city_distances_extended.csv` (5 pts)

- Code successfully executed with the 100-node city map.
- Total distance reported was ~1000000, indicating presence of unreachable paths (penalized as expected).
- The architecture handled large datasets without errors or memory issues.

####  How to Add More Cars (5 pts)

To support multiple cars:
- **Modify Route Representation**: Encode multiple routes in each individual (e.g., list of lists).
- **Fitness Function Update**: Sum total distances across all routes (cars).
- **Constraints Enforcement**:
  - Max nodes per car.
  - Balanced route lengths.
  - Each node visited exactly once across cars.
- **Crossover & Mutation Adaptation**: Apply operators per car or across car routes.
